pyCover attempts to download and add the missing artwork from your songs
in your iTunes library.

When you run pyCover it will try to open iTunes, and start searching your
library for albums with missing covers. You can then select any of these
albums, click on the "Download covers" button, and pyCover will search
and download the required cover, so you can automatically save it to
your album.
